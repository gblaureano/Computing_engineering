# Course Activities Repository

This repository is intended for storing and organizing the activities carried out during the course. Each subject will be represented by a branch, and within each branch, you will find the specific activities for that subject.

## Repository Structure

The structure of the repository follows the model below:

- **Branches**: Each branch is dedicated to a specific subject.
  - Example: `subject-name`.
  
- **Folders within each branch**: Inside each branch, the lessons will be organized by folder, according to the subject, and each folder will contain the activity completed for that specific lesson.
  - Example: `lesson_1 -> activity_name_1, activity_name_2, activity_name_3`, etc.
